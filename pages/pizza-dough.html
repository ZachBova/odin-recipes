<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li> Flour </li>   
<li> Sugar</li>
<li>Yeast </li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Olive Oil</li>


</ul>

<h2> Directions</h2>


<ol>
    
<li>Combine the bread flour, sugar, yeast and kosher
     salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and combine. While the mixer is running, add the water and 2 tablespoons of the oil and beat until the dough forms into a ball. If the dough is sticky, add additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together in a solid ball. If the dough is too dry, add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth, firm ball.</li>
     <li> Grease a large bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil, add the dough, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in a warm area to let it double in size, about 1 hour. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Cover each with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let them rest for 10 minutes.</li>

<p>
    Cook's Note: Using bread flour will give you a much crisper crust. If you can't find bread flour, you can substitute it with all-purpose flour which will give you a chewier crust.
