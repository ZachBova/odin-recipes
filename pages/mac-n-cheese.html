<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>Macaroni</li>   
<li>Butter</li>
<li>Flour</li>
<li>Milk</li>
<li>Cheese</li>
<li>Seasonings</li>


</ul>

<h2> Directions</h2>


<ol>

<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>
     <li> Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
     <li>
        While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
        </li>  
        <li>
            Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.
        </li> 
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.   
        </li>
